* Following the example in CarExample.java, please use Object Composition to model an Airplane class.
* The Airplane class must be composed of at least 4 other classes (as well as any primitive types you'd like).
* The Airplane class itself should have a fuel capacity (double) variable, as well as a currentFuelLevel variable.
* We'll use these a bit later.
