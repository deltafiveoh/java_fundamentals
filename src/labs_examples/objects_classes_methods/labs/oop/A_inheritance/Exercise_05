Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Parent called will print since it is automatically called as the parent of the object's class. Then child called will print, as it is invoked upon the child class' creation

Output = Parent called
         Child called

public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
